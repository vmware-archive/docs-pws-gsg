You can deploy, update, and scale your applications on Pivotal Web Services
(PWS), which is powered by the Cloud Foundry Platform as a Service (PaaS).

## <a id='signup'></a>Set Up Your PWS Account ##

This step establishes your PWS account and access to the PWS Apps Manager for your account.

Sign up for a Pivotal Web Services account: https://console.run.pivotal.io

The Apps Manager displays after you create an [organization](../concepts/roles.html#organizations) (org). By default, PWS
configures each new org with a [space](../concepts/roles.html#spaces) named `development`.
